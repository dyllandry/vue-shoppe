# Todo

- [ ] Decide on organisation for files and folders
    - I'd like to do an organisation that isn't by "type of part" like "stores, views, components" etc.
    - I'd like to organise based on feature: product, cart, wishlist
- [ ] Remove or replace existing file structure with bare minimum that I can turn into my chosen file organisation
